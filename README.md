# Fokus Project

## Project Overview

The Fokus project was developed as part of Alura’s JavaScript course. It is a web application based on the Pomodoro Technique — a time management method that lasts two hours. You focus on a task for 25 minutes, followed by a 5-minute break, repeating this cycle until the two hours are complete.

## Features

- Three timers for different stages:
  - **Focus:** 25 minutes of uninterrupted study  
  - **Short Break:** A short countdown for a brief rest  
  - **Long Break:** A longer pause to recharge before returning to focused study  
- A study list where you can add and manage your study topics (e.g., "Study Physics," "Study Math," "Study English")  
- When you start a study session for a topic, just select it and click the 'Start' button under the Focus tab  
- Completed study topics are visually marked with a green background to indicate completion

## Technologies Used
